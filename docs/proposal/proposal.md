## SECTION B

### Introduction
For our final year project, we propose the development of an easy-to-use but powerful and comprehensive code metrics and analysis tool. This end-goal is for this tool to take the form of an IDE plugin to display useful data relating to the performance, structure and style of a codebase in a clear and intuitive manner.

### Outline
The tool that we plan to develop will provide the end user with a deeper understanding of their codebase, through the use of metrics such as cyclomatic complexity and maintainability index, and by creating useful and easy to understand graphs and diagrams relating to class relationships, test coverage and other analytics that can be scaled to the desired level of detail for a more general or specific overview. All of this will be computed on a back-end server and displayed to the user in a responsive, consistent and attractive user interface that allows for viewing multiple or specific metrics and is simple to navigate.
