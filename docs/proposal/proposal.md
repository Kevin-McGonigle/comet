## SECTION B

### Introduction
For our final year project, we propose the development of an easy-to-use but powerful and comprehensive code metrics and analysis tool. This end-goal is for this tool to take the form of an IDE plugin to display useful data relating to the performance, structure and style of a codebase in a clear and intuitive manner.

### Outline
The tool that we plan to develop will provide the end user with a deeper understanding of their codebase, through the use of metrics such as cyclomatic complexity and maintainability index, and by creating useful and easy to understand graphs and diagrams relating to class relationships, test coverage and other analytics that can be scaled to the desired level of detail for a more general or specific overview. All of this will be computed on a back-end server and displayed to the user in a responsive, consistent and attractive user interface that allows for viewing multiple or specific metrics and is simple to navigate.

### Background
The basis for idea was formed as a consequence of both of us having worked with large codebases as part of our INTRA placements, the likes of which often prove to be daunting and confusing, especially to those who are unfamiliar with it. We both struggled at times to get to grips with such a broad and complicated codebase, often finding ourselves going down the wrong path to get to where we need to be, or suffering because of overly complex and under documented segments of code. We also experienced a lack of cohesiveness and consistency between requirements, design, implementation and testing that served only to add to the confusion.

This confusion prompted the same response in both of us, and we both came up with different but closely related ideas for tools to rectify the problem. One of these ideas was for a code metrics tool, for displaying various measurements relating to the performance of code. The other involved a tool for seamlessly converting standardised diagrams such as class diagrams into blank, object-oriented code, as well as deriving such diagrams from a codebase. After some detailed discussion, we arrived at a solution to incorporate the best concepts from both ideas to deliver a complete, comprehensive tool for users of all levels to understand and improve their code in a variety of ways.

### Achievements
Our project will be designed and created with every level of developer in mind and we will endeavour to ensure that our finished product is both sufficiently usable and educational for the novice programmer as well as robust and feature-rich enough to satisfy the more advanced user.

In terms of functionality, we will seek to compute and display the following metrics, analytics and resources in a concise and intelligent manner.
- Cyclomatic Complexity
- Class Diagram
- Technical Debt
- Test Coverage
- Comment Coverage
- Coupling
- Abstractness
- Inheritance Tree
- Nesting Depth
- Class/Method Summaries
